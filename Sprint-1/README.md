### Apologies:
n/a

### Summary of Conversation:
This was the first meeting for the team so we strarted discussing how to approach the problem. We went through the video and brief thorougly and identified what we are planning to include in our appliacation. We decided some client requests are out of the scope for now and justified our decisions.
We have decided to focus on:
* **Platform: Web application** Every device that can connect to the internet does also have a web browser. Application can be accessed from different operating systems. There is no delays with people trying to install an application.
* **Main User Group: Friends playing virtually** 
* **Added value:** Easy to create - Randomized questions from our database, Automated - Host can also fairly participate in a quiz, Personal - Option to make a custom quiz and run it on the platform, Easy to join - All you need to join is a QuizID

After that we discussed out strengths and knowledge and decided how to split up the group.

| Name | Strengths |
| ------------- |-------------|
| Neja | `Frontend` `Product Management` `UX/UI` |
| Cameron | `Backend` `C#` `Databases` `Team Management` |
| Fayzuddin | `Backend` `Research` |
| Oskar | `Backend` `C#` `Java` `Networks` `Databases` |
| Mengqi | `Frontend` `Product Manager` `Research` |
| Jordan | `Backend` `C#` `Java` |
| Melvin | `C#` `Databases` |
| Daniel | `Frontend` `Report` `Research` |
| Blazej | `Backend` `Databases` |
| Andrew | `Frontend` |

We decided to have two team leadears, who would be split between the frontend and backend group and also act as Product Managers and Scrum Masters in daily meetings. Frontend group is also in charge of Design and User Experience. Backend group also deals with Networks, Databases and Research into potential quiz questions.
* Team leaders: Neja, Cameron
* Frontend: Neja, Mengqi, Daniel, Andrew
* Backend: Cameron, Fayzuddin, Oskar, Jordan, Melvin, Blazej

Oskar has been working on how we will implement the networking aspect of the application with the .NET framework and how to manage sessions.

Cameron discussed the algorithm he created for getting unique questions from the database and how the database structure will look like. Jordan has set up the server on Azure, where we will also host tha database as soon there is some data to add to it. Melvin was looking into other competitors and made a document with all the meschanisms they are using that we may want to implement. Blazej was not sure what his task was so he started some testing on the backend. Fayzuddin started coding the backend so we have a starting file for it. Neja was looking into design and how our visual identity would look like. After discussing with the rest of the team we decided to go for darker mode with bright neon signs as our signature graphic. She also started redesigning the prototype to fit that look. Daniel worked on the User Stories, while Karen found some templates we could use on the frontend. Andrew wrote down some use cases for the users.
