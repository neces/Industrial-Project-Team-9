### Summary of Conversation:
This was the first meeting for the team so we strarted discussing how to approach the problem. We went through the video and brief thorougly and identified what we are planning to include in our appliacation. We decided some client requests are out of the scope for now and justified our decisions.
We have decided to focus on:
* **Platform: Web application** Every device that can connect to the internet does also have a web browser. Application can be accessed from different operating systems. There is no delays with people trying to install an application.
* **Main User Group: Friends playing virtually** 
* **Added value:** Easy to create - Randomized questions from our database, Automated - Host can also fairly participate in a quiz, Personal - Option to make a custom quiz and run it on the platform, Easy to join - All you need to join is a QuizID

After that we discussed out strengths and knowledge and decided how to split up the group.

| Name | Strengths |
| ------------- |-------------|
| Neja | `Frontend` `Product Management` `UX/UI` |
| Cameron | `Backend` `C#` `Databases` `Team Management` |

| Melvin | `C#` `Databases` |
| Daniel | `Frontend` `Report` `Research` |

We decided to have two team leadears, who would be split between the frontend and backend group and also act as Product Managers and Scrum Masters in daily meetings. Frontend group is also in charge of Design and User Experience. Backend group also deals with Networks, Databases and Research into potential quiz questions.
