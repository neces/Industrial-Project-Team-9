## Day [5] - Scrum Meeting, Oct 16th, 9.30 am
The Scrum Master for this meeting was **Cameron McNeill**

### Members Present:
Melvin, Andrew, Neja, Mengqi, Cameron, Daniel, Fayzuddin, Oskar, Jordan

### Members Not Present:
n/a

### Apologies:
Blazej

### Summary of Conversation:
Neja started the meeting by describing how the structure of the frontend will change due to a react-router library that will allow us to have pages with separate urls. Currently we have Home, Host and Quiz. The priority is on making Home and Quiz work for the Monday client meeting, as we can avoid using the Host page by starting the session with a call on Postman. Cameron worked on the backend API and added functionality that the user is able to leave the quiz. Fayzuddin is working on an algorithm that calculates the difficulty. Jordan has connected the database with web app on the Azure website, now the connection has to be updated in the backend as well. Oskar updated the API call list for requesting the questions. Melvin is writing up a rough version of the report and looking into how to do a user manual. He has also been helping Daniel set up everything for the user testing. Daniel continued with CSS stlying, Andrew and Mengqi were still working on their components.
