Fayzuddin is working on the database and getting our questions on the server. Oskar switched over to the frontend team the day before and he was still learning React. Andrew has refactored the timer code, which now gets the data from the game status call. Daniel has completed the feedback form and distibuted the documents needed for testing. Mengqi finished reactions for when the user clicks an answer but still has to connect it to the database to check correct answers. Neja created both the hosting page and the waiting page for the host. She also decided to keep track of Sprint 3 bugs on GitHub issues, as they are easier to manage and update, and assigned them to the frontend team.

### Summary of Conversation:
Cameron did some general bug fixes on the backend and connected the SQL database to the backend, so the app is now getting questions from our database. Fayzuddin helped deploy the database and is now working with Jordan and Cameron on some user testing. Jordan also helped with the database. Oskar was still working on a React totorial. Mengqi implemented select answer and disabled answers after selected which now work well. She still needs to find a way for the correct answer to display. Neja merged Mengqi's and Andrew's code to the newest version, as their code was not compatible with it. She also added the leave button, where players can leave the session during the quiz. Daniel has been working on the mobile views, the homepage should be now mobile friendly.

Andrew has worked on the function to only fetch the correct answer once the time reaches zero, to prevent cheating.
